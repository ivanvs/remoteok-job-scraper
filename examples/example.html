          When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy
          equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are
          scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use
          them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an
          imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main
          domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful!

        </h1>
        <div class="markdown">
          Our Mission\nHow your customers are engaging with you is changing. Driven by new generations, consumption is
          shifting away from physical goods to experiences. To remain relevant, brands must offer value-creating
          experiences that include events, appointments, classes, and field activations to engage consumers and build
          deeper relationships.\n\nAnyRoad enables brands to build and strengthen long-term relationships with consumers
          through experiences. We do this by modernizing and consolidating the experience tech stack, capturing,
          ingesting, and organizing experiential and consumer data, and applying data science to give your teams the
          intelligence they need to run industry-leading experiential programs and positively change consumer behavior
          and grow revenue.\n\nThe Role\n\nWe are looking for a process-oriented, analytically-minded, driven manager to
          help our Revenue team become more efficient and effective as we scale. This role will be an integral part of a
          fast-paced, high-growth team that is continually evolving existing and building new business processes while
          analyzing historic results, and making business recommendations.  You will both own important functional areas
          for our team, as well as take on special projects. You will partner closely with members of our Sales,
          Marketing, Customer Success, and Business Development teams. \n\nThis role will work fully remote or in a
          hybrid environment out of our San Francisco office and will report directly to our Head of Revenue Operations.
          \n\nAbout AnyRoad\nAnyRoad is the leading Experience Relationship Management (ERM) platform enabling global
          brands to properly measure, scale, and implement their experiential marketing campaigns. AnyRoad helps
          companies create brand loyalty, change consumer behavior, and better understand their brand associations by
          providing them with data intelligence sourced from experience-based marketing. Companies like Anheuser-Busch,
          Honda, Michaels, and Tabasco all count on AnyRoad to measure the impact of their experiential marketing.
          AnyRoad’s software integrates into CRM, loyalty, ERP, and POS systems to complete the loop, building the model
          of exactly how these experiences build loyalty, increase brand perception, and increase revenue.\n\nOur
          day-to-day is infused with a sense of collaboration, motivation, and the shared goal of helping AnyRoad
          succeed. We emphasize sharing knowledge, taking ownership, and continual learning. When we hire, we’re looking
          as much for character, curiosity and communication skills as for role-specific aptitude. Ensuring a diverse
          and inclusive workplace where we learn from each other is core to our values. It might be an expected comment,
          but it’s worth saying that we really thoroughly enjoy working together. \n\n#Salary and compensation\n No
          salary data published by company so we estimated salary based on similar jobs related to Marketing and Non
          Tech jobs that are similar:\n\n $65,000 &mdash; $95,000/year\n \n\n#Location\nRemote<br />

          When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy
          equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are
          scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use
          them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an
          imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main
          domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful!

          \nNice to meet you, we’re Vesta Healthcare.\n\nVesta Healthcare is a startup with a simple mission: Delivering
          extraordinary outcomes by unlocking the power of caregivers. Caregivers are one of the largest, most untapped
          resources in the healthcare delivery system and are the unsung heroes of their care recipients. Yet despite
          their vital role, they are largely unsupported and invisible to the healthcare ecosystem.\n\nAt Vesta
          Healthcare, we enable people with personal assistance to thrive at home, in their community by assuring the
          people they rely on, their caregivers, have the resources, data, and support they need.&nbsp; We achieve this
          through a combination of analytics, technology, services, and deep healthcare expertise. Our analytics help
          identify and target the right people and populations. Our technology creates real-time connectivity and
          actionable data out of observations. Our services connect to real people who can help when needs arise, and
          our healthcare expertise helps us understand how we create value for both payers and providers.\n\nOur program
          monitors in real-time, identifying issues before they become health events, and helping connect those in need
          with those who can help via technologies such as video, chat, and telephone. Our technology platform includes
          home-based mobile applications, a clinical dashboard, and data analytics on data not previously available to
          health professionals. We are disrupting a $109 billion industry and have recently closed our latest funding
          round with a blue-chip list of investors.\n\nWe’re looking to add to our team of experts who care deeply about
          our mission. &nbsp;\n\nOur team is passionate, driven, collaborative, intellectually curious, and excited
          about the opportunity to transform our&nbsp; healthcare system. We're inspired by caregivers and seek to
          create a platform that recognizes, utilizes and supports the vital role they play.&nbsp; We strive to&nbsp;
          continuously learn, explore, experiment and achieve results. We are here to improve the quality of life for
          caregivers and care recipients, allowing them to focus on the important things (like going to the mall with
          their grandkids)\n\nThe ideal teammate would be…\n\nAn individual who’s passionate about people, data, and

          When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy
          equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are
          scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use
          them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an
          imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main
          domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful!

          When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy
          equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are
          scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use
          them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an
          imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main
          domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful!

          When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy
          equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are
          scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use
          them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an
          imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main
          domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful!

          When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy
          equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are
          scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use
          them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an
          imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main
          domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful!

          that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any

          When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy
          equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are
          scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use
          them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an
          imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main
          domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful!

          Xero is a beautiful, easy-to-use platform that helps small businesses and their accounting and bookkeeping
          advisors grow and thrive. \n\nAt Xero, our purpose is to make life better for people in small business, their
          advisors, and communities around the world. This purpose sits at the centre of everything we do. We support
          our people to do the best work of their lives so that they can help small businesses succeed through better
          tools, information and connections. Because when they succeed they make a difference, and when millions of
          small businesses are making a difference, the world is a more beautiful place.\n\nWe are looking for a Senior
          Security Engineer to join our Identity and Access team based in either New Zealand or the east coast of
          Australia.\n\nAs a Senior Security Engineer, you’ll ensure our platform security systems are deployed and
          maintained to support the requirements of our Xero teams.\n\nWho's the team?\nThe mission of the Identity and
          Access team is to provide the right individuals, the right access, at the right time. We’re a collective of
          engineers from varying backgrounds that focus our efforts on making our platform and applications easy to use
          for our engineers. We build guard rails rather than roadblocks, and strive to make it easy for our customers
          to ship secure products with as little friction as possible. We’re looking for a curious cloud engineer to
          join our team and help us continue to keep Xero secure.\n\nWhat's the role?\nAs a Senior Security Engineer,
          you’ll be hands-on solving problems at scale in a massive AWS environment. You’ll become deeply familiar with
          the capabilities of our vendors to build and support modern and adaptable security services that will delight
          our customers. We run mission-critical infrastructure, and you’ll build resilient and scalable systems.
          Automation will be the standard for you, and you’ll seek new and interesting ways to reduce our operational
          overheads. Most importantly, you’ll be a team player and get to work with an awesome group of engineers in an
          amazing and unique working environment.\n\nXero is a Rainbow Tick certified employer.\n\nXero strongly
          encourages employees and contractors to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to work from a Xero office, or
          engage in any face-to-face Xero business.  \n\nPlease include a cover letter in your application, telling us
          why you’re a great fit for this position. \n\n#Salary and compensation\n No salary data published by company
          so we estimated salary based on similar jobs related to Video, API, Travel, Senior, Engineer, Backend,
          Analyst, iOS, Developer, Finance, Mobile, Android, Digital Nomad, Education, Salesforce, Legal, Sales, SaaS,

          When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy
          equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are
          scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use
          them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an
          imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main
          domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful!

          When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy
          equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are
          scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use
          them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an
          imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main
          domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful!

          When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy
          equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are
          scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use
          them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an
          imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main
          domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful!

          When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy
          equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are
          scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use
          them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an
          imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main
          domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful!
